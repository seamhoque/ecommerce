A user interacts with the view - by clicking on a link or submitting a form.
The Controller handles the user input, and transfers the information to the model
The Model receives the information and updates it's state (adds data to a database, for example, or calculates todays date)
The View checks the state of the Model and responds accordingly (listing the newly entered data, maybe)
The View waits for another interaction from the user.
